# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I'm Alec Fessler, and this is where I share my projects, experiments, and anything else Iâ€™m working on.

Iâ€™m currently diving into various areas of software development, including:
- Systems programming in C, C++, and Zig
- Lock-free programming
- Real time systems
- Machine learning and computer vision

Feel free to explore my repositories, open issues, or even suggest improvements.
