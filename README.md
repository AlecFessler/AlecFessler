# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I'm Alec Fessler, and this is where I share my projects, experiments, and anything else Iâ€™m working on.

Iâ€™m currently diving into various areas of software development, including:
- Low-level programming and system design
- Data structures, algorithms, and real-time applications
- Machine learning, computer vision, and adaptive techniques

Feel free to explore my repositories, open issues, or even suggest improvements.
